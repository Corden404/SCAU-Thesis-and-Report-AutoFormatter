With the rapid development of e-commerce, logistics distribution efficiency has become a core indicator of the competitiveness of modern logistics enterprises. Traditional path planning algorithms (such as A* and Dijkstra) often suffer from heavy computational loads and poor real-time performance when dealing with dynamic and multi-constrained logistics environments. This paper proposes a path optimization scheme based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). By constructing a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model and employing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, autonomous decision-making and path optimization for delivery vehicles in complex urban traffic environments are achieved. Experimental results demonstrate that the system outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of delivery time cost and path stability, effectively handling sudden traffic conditions and enhancing the intelligence of logistics distribution.
